#  CLI Commands REST API (SPRINGBOOT MVC)

A RESTful API that stores and retrieves command-line snippets with descriptions and target platforms â€” useful for quickly looking up commands you often forget.

This backend-only project is inspired by the need for a lightweight, fast API to organize shell commands by platform (Linux, Git, etc.).
